          - I was in grade 9 when I found out that I could solve math<br />
          problems, before I went to that school I was very afraid of<br />
          math. This school helped me to be good at math.

          - Being a fast learner for me is a skill because you can't maximize
          <br />it if you don't hone it. This senior high school is when I
          discovered <br />that I can easily learn in any field, I noticed that
          I can quickly get<br />
          what is being taught whether verbal or action. I used and honed
          these<br />
          skills to benefit me in college.

        <dd>
          - Last year I found out that I have teaching skills. One time in math
          <br />class, my classmate was confused about the topic because it was
          not <br />easy. I tried to break down our topic with him so that he
          could somehow <br />understand and I was surprised because he is good
          at math, students<br />
          who are good at academics are not given priority because they are
          afraid<br />
          to answer so one of the professions I want is to be teacher.
